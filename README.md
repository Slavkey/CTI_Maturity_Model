# CTI_Maturity_Model

## What it is? Who is it for? What's the purpose?

**Cyber Threat Intelligence Maturity Model (CTI-MM)** is a theoretical representation of CTI organizational development. The development in this case is meant as a process during which standards, baselines and procedures are created, shared across the organization and matured (including testing and improving). The term "maturity" relates to the degree of profesional development of services and products, formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, managed result metrics, and active optimization of the processes.
Just like Capability Maturity Model Integrated (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) can be used to "(...) guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organizations", so the CTI-MM can be used by all of you, for whom the constant development and improvement of intel services you offer is important. 

In overall, my intent when creating a CTI-MM was to help intel SMEs, their key stakeholders and business owners, design, develop and mature CTI capabilities in a structured and systemic way. 
Since the budgets are alwasy too small, and the area of operations CTI covers always so vast, the most important ideas behind this model were to:
<ul>
  <li>create a detailed vision of how CTI and its capabilities can be developed and matured in organization</li>
  <li>provide a handy (I hope) tool for self assessment of current CTI capabilities and processes on every possible level</li>
  <li>help CTI SMEs in the design and development of intel programms that best fits the needs of their organizations or customers</li>
</ul>

## How is it designed and why?

CTI-MM is based on my personnal expierience, working in (threat) intelligence for many years 

of interviews of industry experts in cyber security, former intelligence practitioners, and open-source research (plus a little of my personal views). It represents a logical and meaningful way the different aspects of producing intelligence should be put together for cyber security at all levels. The mind map is not meant to be THE way of doing things, but more as guide for how everything CAN be done. Pick and choose what you want to implement and build and expand as you go.
